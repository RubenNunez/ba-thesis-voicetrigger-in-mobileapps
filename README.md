# Integration of Voice Control Technologies in Mobile Apps

## About the Project
This bachelor's thesis is centered around the integration of voice control technologies into mobile applications, with a special emphasis on the detection of trigger words within an app's context. This repository contains the code written as part of the thesis. Some of it consists of simple code examples written for the thesis, while others can be used for the final product.

For the machine learning (ML) part of this project, the 'data' folder containing datasets is not included in the repository because of its large size and its non-public nature. It needs to be downloaded manually and placed in the project's root folder.

## Getting Started
- The code is based on a Anaconda Python 3.9 environment.
- It's compatible with Mac OS; testing on Windows hasn't been done.

## Dependencies
- Anaconda Environment
  - name: (ba-environment)
  - Python 3.11.6
