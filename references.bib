  abstract  = {Computers are at the center of almost everything related to audio. Whether for \
               synthesis in music production, recording in the studio, or mixing in live sound, \
               the computer plays an essential part. Audio effects plug-ins and virtual \
               instruments are implemented as software computer code. Music apps are computer \
               programs run on a mobile device. All these tools are created by programming \
               a computer.  Hack Audio: An Introduction to Computer Programming and Digital \
               Signal Processing in MATLAB provides an introduction for musicians and audio \
               engineers interested in computer programming. It is intended for a range of \
               readers including those with years of programming experience and those ready \
               to write their first line of code. In the book, computer programming is used to \
               create audio effects using digital signal processing. By the end of the book, \
               readers implement the following effects: signal gain change, digital summing, \
               tremolo, auto-pan, mid/side processing, stereo widening, distortion, echo, \
               filtering, equalization, multi-band processing, vibrato, chorus, flanger, phaser, \
               pitch shifter, auto-wah, convolution and algorithmic reverb, vocoder, transient \
               designer, compressor, expander, and de-esser. Throughout the book, several types \
               of test signals are synthesized, including: sine wave, square wave, sawtooth wave, \
               triangle wave, impulse train, white noise, and pink noise. Common visualizations \
               for signals and audio effects are created including: waveform, characteristic \
               curve, goniometer, impulse response, step response, frequency spectrum, and \
               spectrogram. In total, over 200 examples are provided with completed code \
               demonstrations.},
